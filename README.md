'index.html' is the home page for the site, and 'show.html' is the 'Problem Set' page.

Since we can't modify the database on the website, "add.html" is useless, and the only way to access that page is to enter the url ".../add" yourself.

With the same reason, the delete button 'x' in the 'Problem Set' page is useless too.

I just keep those two because I think they are cute.
Fight me.



'js/problem_set.js' is the database, you need to modify it and add new words yourself.
